# In this project, I learned how to create an application that displays the weather information for a specific location based on the user's search. This is done by retrieving data from API's such as mapbox.com and weatherstack.com. I used HTML and CSS in the front end, Node.js with the Express framework in the backend, and was able to to deploy this application to a production environment using Heroku, which can be accessed via this link: https://rusal-weather-app.herokuapp.com/
